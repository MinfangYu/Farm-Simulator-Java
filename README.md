## Overview of the Project

In this game, you are a farmer lost in an alien planet. You can choose how many days your game will last, set up your farmer and select your farm type.
You have to earn enough money to buy a spaceship in a limited time to return home. You can buy crops and animals to manage on your farm. You will need to care for your crops and animals to make the biggest profit for your farm. 
There will also be some random events happen every day.

The GUI is written in Swing. I also wrote Javadoc and JUnit tests for this project.
